## Food
This year we are hoping you'll explore the exquisite dining options that Austin
has to offer. You'll have 2 hours for lunch, so be sure to factor in wait times and walking distances into your plans. **Be weary of wait times, especially with BBQ restaurants.**

Here are a few suggestions from the conference organizers:
