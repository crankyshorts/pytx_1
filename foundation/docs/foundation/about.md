# About Us
The PyTexas Foundation is a 501(c)3 non-profit run by a Texas-based volunteer group. We are Python enthusiasts that want to share the programming language with the world, starting right here in Texas. The PyTexas Conference is currently the foundationâ€™s only fundraising event of the year.
