The PyTexas Foundation's mission is to build vibrant community of Python
enthusiasts in the state of Texas. As PyTexas continues to grow, we 
continuously rely on the generosity and support of individuals like you who 
believe in our vision and want to contribute to its growth. The Friends of 
PyTexas program is your opportunity to make a direct impact on the future of 
the PyTexas Foundation, and by extension, the Python Community in Texas. Your 
donation will not only allow us to continue providing the programs you have 
come to know and love, such as the PyTexas Conference and PyTexas Meetup, but 
also allow us to expand and offer new programs, such as local meetup support,
satellite conferences in other Texas cities, and even free educational 
resources. Become a Friend of PyTexas today and help us make the Python 
Community in Texas the biggest in the world!
